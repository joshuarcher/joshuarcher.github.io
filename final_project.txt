How do you use this? this is hacker news for crypto
- see a list of posts on the front page
- upvote posts
- submit new posts by clicking submit on the navbarItem

This was going for an A grade
- I used an external stylesheet
- cookies are used so that users can upvote twice
- there is JS involved
- there are JS events like the "onload" on the body of site_index
- site_index is constructed by first creating DOM elements

- uses AJAX for an async call to PHP
- there are timestamps on the Database
- page is refreshed every 5 seconds
